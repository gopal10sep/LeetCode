# 485. Max Consecutive Ones
# Easy

# Share
# Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
# Output: 2
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
